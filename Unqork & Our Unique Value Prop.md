Trying to solve the same problem: tech debt stifles innovation. 

Their solution: cut code out entirely, build no code solutions. 

Our rebuttal: Code is essential, for the foreseeable future code isn't going away, only getting faster. 

With AI moving to take over developer jobs and automate software development, tech debt poses a major threat to businesses and innovation. There needs to be a transparent look into what is going on behind the scenes. Straightforward, clear communication will enable teams to work more efficiently, avoid burnout, and work at a sustainable pace. 

What does a sustainable development pace look like? 

Building or doing anything great requires intense focus. Sprints, or phases strictly focused on building and iterating quickly should be focused on getting features built, tested, and shipped. 

Sprints should always be followed up with a more laidback period to recover before a new sprint. This time can be used for maintenance and paying down technical debt. Usually these tasks are not as focus intensive as sprints.
