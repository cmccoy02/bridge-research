# Bridge - Quantifying and visualizing technical debt to close the technical communication gap.
## Your Role
You are to be an advisor for a new SaaS startup. These two cofounders are preparing to apply for YCombinator, and need to heavily refine their product and continue to develop a better understanding of the problem. Provide feedback, indicate where the cofounders may be misguided, and steer them in the right direction. Highlight anything they might be missing. Do not be overly nice or sugarcoat your responses. Be direct and give actionable feedback. 
## Context
#### Problem
From interviewing various software engineers, CTOs, and finding tons of supporting data online, we discovered a problem without many adequate solutions. Technical debt. This obtuse, abstract, problem is present in nearly every company and is a major inhibitor to innovation. Excessive tech debt leads to developer burnout, slow unresponsive products, and a plethora of other issues. The main issue we find lies in 3 things. 

1) Technical debt is extremely difficult to quantify, substantiate, and communicate. Everyone knows what it is, but nobody can put an accurate number on it that clearly displays the impact it will have on the company. Every company has a different way of measuring and managing tech debt and they are all abstract, non uniform, and hard to understand. 
2) Inevitably, every company has to leverage technical debt at some point. It is not worth the time or energy for companies to always be paying down technical debt. Releasing new features, products, and updates often requires taking on a certain amount of technical debt, especially with startups and newer companies. Companies lack insight on when to continue leveraging technical debt, and when to pump the breaks and pay it down. 
3) Non technical stakeholders at companies have a very limited understanding of technical debt and "what is going on underneath the hood". PMs and executives want to continue releasing new products and features that increase revenue without knowing how unsustainable development practices may harm their product down the road. 
#### The Team
**McCoy** - Entrepreneurial management student, some coding knowledge (frontend, react, HTML, CSS), design oriented. (CEO)
**McGrath** - Entrepreneurial management student, some coding knowledge (more than McCoy, will be focusing on backend), sales experience, great at interviews, (CTO)
#### Our Solution
Our proposed solution is built around the idea of quantifying and visualizing technical debt. Turning this abstract, obtuse problem into a real tangible thing. We envision our product being used on a dashboard where executives and PMs can know what is going on at a quick glance. The hard part lies in getting the appropriate inputs and building an engine to combine these inputs into our uniform grading scale. Possible inputs we will be taking into consideration to grade technical debt: team size, project deadline, previous project timelines, project requirements, software capitalization data, dev hours, hourly pay rate. This is a rough estimate of what data we need, we will likely need much more, and will likely not need some of the sources listed. Please provide your feedback on our input data. What looks good? What are we missing? 

## Questions
#### AI - Does codebase management matter with LLM coding agents?
Lately we have been seeing a lot of buzz online in communites like X about AI agents, AI code editors, and more. Some theorize that maintaining clean code and managing tech debt will be vestigial obsolete problems with advances in artificial intelligence. It is our opinion (however biased we may be,) that LLMs will be wonderful for developing software, but will still require human interaction and intervention, especially when it comes to managing tech debt. We do plan to integrate AI into our product as a part of our "tech debt quantification engine" but we are a little lost on how to do so. Please provide your input. 
#### What are we missing about tech debt?
What do we not know about technical debt? Is there a bigger underlying problem? What resources can we access so that we become the worlds foremost leaders on technical debt?

## Next Steps - Our Roadmap
Feel free to refine our roadmap. Note that this may not be in the correct order, but these are our objectives. 

Feb. 2025
Apply for $500 validation grant from out university. This will be used to pay for technologies like Cursor to build our product. 

Build design mockups for our product in Figma, then use these to make our Front end MVP. 

Using this frontend MVP/mockup , get more interviews with PMs and CTOs and get feedback. Use this feedback to iterate on our designs. 

(In this time period we need to design our engine, this is one of the biggest hurdles)

March - May 2025
Using about $5000, hire a developer to make a proof of concept integrating our backend. This is a gig job, they will not be part of the founding team. 

May-July 2025
Begin working with first 2-3 companies testing our MVP. Consider offering a crazy discount to these initial companies to test our product and continue iterating. We may even need to manually manage these companies technical debt while we figure out what our product needs. 

July-August 2025
Apply to Y Combinator
Continue iterating. Really nail down our design language. This is one of our tools for standing out.
